/**
 * @description
 * This file serves as the central placeholder for all Drizzle ORM schema definitions.
 * As the application grows, all table schemas (e.g., projects, datasets, experiments)
 * will be defined in or imported into this file.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Acts as the single source of truth for the database schema.
 * - Used by Drizzle Kit to generate and manage SQL migration files.
 *
 * @notes
 * - This file is intentionally left empty in this step. Schemas will be added in
 *   the next step of the implementation plan.

// Schemas for projects, datasets, experiments, and deployments will be defined here.
