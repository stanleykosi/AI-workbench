# CAGR means Compound Annual Growth Rate and is a measure of the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period longer than one year.
# The formula for CAGR is:
# CAGR = (EV / BV)^(1/n) - 1
# where:
# EV = Ending Value
# BV = Beginning Value
# n = Number of periods
# The CAGR formula is derived from the compound interest formula.
# The CAGR metric is useful for comparing investments with different time periods.
# For example, if you have two investments with different time periods, you can use CAGR to compare their annual growth rates.
# The CAGR metric is often used in finance and investing to analyze the performance of investments over time.
