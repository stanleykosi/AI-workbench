@description
This file marks the 'endpoints' directory as a Python package.

This directory is designated to hold all Modal functions that deploy web-facing
API endpoints, such as the FastAPI application for model inference. By organizing
endpoint definitions here, we maintain a clear separation between orchestration
logic (workflows), task execution logic (activities), and serving logic (endpoints).
