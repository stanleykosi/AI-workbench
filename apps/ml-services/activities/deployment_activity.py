@description
This module defines the Temporal activity for deploying a model as a Modal web endpoint.
The activity now runs locally within the Temporal worker container on Modal.

Key components:
- `DeployModelActivityParams` & `DeployModelActivityResult`: Dataclasses for type-safe
  data exchange between the workflow and the activity.
- `deploy_model_activity`: The Temporal activity that executes the deployment logic
  directly within the worker container.
